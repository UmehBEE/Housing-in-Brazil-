## Project Overview
This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on the dataset of homes for sale in Brazil - to determine if there are regional differences in the real estate market. Also, to look at southern Brazil to see if there is a relationship between home size and price, similar to what you saw with housing in some states in Mexico.

## Running the program
You can input 'Housing in Brazil.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Anaconda's command prompt on a Windows 10 machine.

## Program Details
 
This project works with a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico through the real estate website Properati.com. With a  goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:
* Create data visualizations like scatter_mapbox showing the location of the properties in Brazil.
* Examine the relationship between "area_m2" and "price_usd" in three states in the "South" region of Brazil.

## Requirements
Language: Python 3.6 or above
Libraries: pandas, numpy, time
## Project Data
Brazil-real-estate-1.csv - Dataset containing all housing information for Brazil provided by WorldQuant.

Brazil-real-estate-2.csv - Dataset containing all  housing information for Brazil provided by WorldQuant. Note: This does not include the 'Price_usd' data column but has the 'state' data.

## Built with
* Python 3.6.6 - The language used to develop this.
* pandas - One of the libraries used for this.
* numpy - One of the libraries used for this.
## Acknowledgements
pandas docs - pandas documentation was immensely helpful in understanding the implemention of pandas methods used in this project.
WorldQuant - WorldQuant Data science lab and their instructors were extremely helpful while I was pursuing this project.
